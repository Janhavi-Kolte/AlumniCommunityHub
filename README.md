# AlumniCommunityHub
PG-DAC Alumni Community Hub Project
The Alumni Community Hub is an innovative online platform tailored to serve the evolving needs of alumni, students and administrators within community. Alumni are valuable assets who carry forward the legacy and values of their alma mater into the wider world. This platform is designed to strengthen the bond between alumni and their institution by providing a centralized space where they can connect, collaborate, and contribute.

The college struggles with managing and engaging its alumni effectively due to fragmented data and inadequate communication tools. This leads to outdated contact information, missed networking opportunities, and limited alumni involvement in college activities. The Alumni Community Hub seeks to address these issues by providing a centralized platform that consolidates alumni data, enhances communication, and fosters a strong network. By streamlining information access and engagement opportunities, the hub ensures that alumni stay connected, informed, and actively participate in the collegeâ€™s community and development.

To build this project following technologies were used:
Backend: Java, SpringBoot
Frontend: React Js, HTML, CSS
Database: MySQL
IDE: Eclipse for backend development
     VS Code for frontend development
     MySQL Workbench for Database
